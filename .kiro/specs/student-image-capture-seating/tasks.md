# Implementation Plan: Student Image Capture and Seating Position Estimation

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the student image capture feature into discrete coding tasks. The feature enables teachers to trigger photo capture requests during online sessions, students upload photos directly to Azure Blob Storage within a 30-second window, and GPT-4o analyzes the images to estimate seating positions based on projector visibility.

The implementation follows this sequence:
1. Set up data models and storage infrastructure
2. Implement backend Azure Functions for capture workflow
3. Build frontend components for teacher and student interfaces
4. Integrate GPT-4o vision API for position estimation
5. Wire SignalR real-time communication
6. Add comprehensive error handling and testing

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property-based tests use fast-check library with minimum 100 iterations
- All property tests include comment tags: `// Feature: student-image-capture-seating, Property N: [Title]`
- Integration tests use Azurite for local development and real Azure services for CI/CD
- Manual testing checklist covers browser compatibility, accessibility, and performance
- GPT-4o vision API requires Azure OpenAI deployment with vision-enabled model
- SAS URLs are student-specific and time-limited for security
- Direct browser-to-blob upload reduces server load and improves performance
- SignalR uses existing dashboard hub infrastructure for real-time communication
