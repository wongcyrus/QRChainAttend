# ProvePresent

**Peer-Verified Event Attendance**

Attendees prove they're actually present by passing verification tokens to each other. No more proxy attendance or remote check-ins.

---

## How It Works

1. **Organizer starts a session** → Entry chains are seeded to random attendees
2. **Attendees pass the chain** → Scan QR codes from others to verify presence
3. **Chain completes** → Everyone who participated is marked present
4. **Exit verification** → Same process when event ends

The chain mechanism ensures attendees must be physically present to participate - you can't pass a QR code to someone who isn't there.

## Authentication

Users are assigned roles through the ExternalOrganizers table:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Organizer | Create and manage events, view attendance |
| Attendee | Join events, participate in verification chains |

To add organizers, use the `manageExternalOrganizers` API endpoint or Azure Portal to add emails to the ExternalOrganizers table.
