# ProvePresent

**Peer-Verified Classroom Attendance**

Students prove they're actually in class by passing verification tokens to each other. No more proxy attendance or buddy check-ins.

---

## How It Works

1. **Teacher starts a session** → Entry chains are seeded to random students
2. **Students pass the chain** → Scan QR codes from classmates to verify presence
3. **Chain completes** → Everyone who participated is marked present
4. **Exit verification** → Same process when class ends

The chain mechanism ensures students must be physically present to participate - you can't pass a QR code to someone who isn't there.

## Quick Start

### Deploy to Azure

**⚠️ Prerequisites**: Azure AD External ID tenant must be configured manually first.

1. **Set up Azure AD External ID** (manual - Azure Portal)
   - Create External ID tenant
   - Create app registration
   - Configure user flows
   - See **[Azure AD Config Guide](docs/deployment/AZURE_AD_CONFIG.md)**

2. **Create credentials file**
   ```bash
   cp .external-id-credentials.template .external-id-credentials
   # Edit with your Azure AD app credentials
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-full-production.sh
   ```

4. **Post-deployment** (manual - Azure Portal)
   - Add Static Web App URL to app registration redirect URIs
   - Configure custom OTP email extension (optional)

See **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** for complete instructions.

### Local Development
